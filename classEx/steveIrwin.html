				<h2>The Story of Logan</h2>
				<div class="story-cover">
					<p class="story">
						<span>In</span> a future where mutants are nearly extinct, an
						elderly and weary Logan leads a quiet life. But when Laura, a mutant
						child pursued by scientists, comes to him for help, he must get her
						to safety. In 2029 the mutant population has shrunken significantly
						due to genetically modified plants designed to reduce mutant powers
						and the X-Men have disbanded. Logan, whose power to self-heal is
						dwindling, has surrendered himself to alcohol and now earns a living
						as a chauffeur. He takes care of the ailing old Professor X whom he
						keeps hidden away. One day, a female stranger asks Logan to drive a
						girl named Laura to the Canadian border. At first he refuses, but
						the Professor has been waiting for a long time for her to appear.
						Laura possesses an extraordinary fighting prowess and is in many
						ways like Wolverine. She is pursued by sinister figures working for
						a powerful corporation; this is because they made her, with Logan's
						DNA. A decrepit Logan is forced to ask himself if he can or even
						wants to put his remaining powers to good use. It would appear that
						in the near-future, the times in which they were able put the world
						to rights with razor sharp claws and telepathic powers are now over.
